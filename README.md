# Portfolio Project Description(s):


The Portfolio Project for my CS325 class at OSU.

For algorithms.py, has the code that checks whether an input will be solvable.
For game_gui.py, it builds a game version of 8-puzzle using pygame.  


## Running the Program(s):
    To run the module I used python 3.8: 
        - pip install python3
    I also used a virtual environment to keep track of all the python versions in my different directories: 
        - python3 -m venv env       # to create env
        - source env/bin/activate   # to activate the virtual env
### Installing Requirments: 
    To install requirments you just need to:
    - pip install -r requirements.txt
###Following commands on the terminal for each module: 
    For algorithms.py: 
        - python algorithms.py 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,0 # to check whether the iteration is solvable. 
    For game_gui.py:
        - python game_gui.py
    
### The n-puzzle is an NP-Complete Problem:

This means that it has no known Polynomial time algorithm that can find the solution to any inversions of the puzzle.


## Result:


__The result should be game GUI that lets you know when you have won.__
